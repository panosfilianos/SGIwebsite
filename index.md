## Motivation
### Music is a beautiful thing. 
It connects people of different backgrounds, from different parts of the world in a nearly automatic, subconcious level. It allows us to experience a mystical, unexplainable joy that is hard to come by in a world that is becoming increasingly logical and technocratic.

Everyone at some point of his life has related with a song mood, sounds and of course a song's lyrics. Music is everywhere and that is why we want to analyze information related to music and see if we are able to create a recommendation system using the tools and techniques that we have learned during the course.

To put it in a nutshell, we are interested in:

 * Analysing the collaborations between artists
 * Analysing song musical similarities and if possible, find the songs that represent the mood and sound of each genre.
 * Finding how consistent each genre is soundwise. Do most songs sound similar, or you can find much diversity? 
 * Analysing the content of song's lyrics of different artists.
 * Analysing all the song's lyrics with focus on sentiment, grammar, lexical similarity as well as a set of other features and plot the results to reach meaningful conclusions

To do that we take things step by step. Do so along with us:
### [Creating our Dataset](https://scoupafi.github.io/SGIwebsite/dataset.html)
### [Building a Collaboration Network](https://scoupafi.github.io/SGIwebsite/collab_networks.html)
### [Building a Musical Similarity Network ](https://scoupafi.github.io/SGIwebsite/musical_sim_networks.html)
