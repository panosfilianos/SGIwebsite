# Text Analysis

Music is a beautiful thing. It connects people of different backgrounds, from different parts of the world in a nearly automatic, subconcious level. It allows us to experience a mystical, unexplainable joy that is hard to come by in a world that is becoming increasingly logical and technocratic.

Albeit, music is not comprised just from a melody that can be comprehensible to all. A major part of the medium,   is the lyrical expression. This feature is grown and brewed in the contextual climate of the locality of each song and can provide unique insight on the feelings and form of expression of millions of people.

Thus, we have decided to have a closer look on what are the attriutes of lyrics of the Top Artists in Spotify's service. Specificaly:

- We have __retrieved__ the Top 100 Artists of 7 Top Genre's of Spotify. This totals to 700 Artists.
- We __fetch__ the current Top 10 songs of each Artist
- We __mine__ the lyrics of each one of these songs
- We __analyse__ those lyrics with focus on sentiment, grammar, lexical similarity as well as a set of other features and __plot__ the results to reach meaningful conclusions

Finally, by utilizing our results we can effectively validated assumptions about characteristics of Genres, build useful tools and unearth improbable or unexpected connections between Artists who speak about the same things (or in the same way or about the same feelings) but belong in different Genres. Based on the outcomes of this research, one can initiate the development of a recommendation search/engine for Genres/Artists/Songs adding additional criteria such as the wordiness, explicitness or how advertising-heavy the results are allowed to be.
